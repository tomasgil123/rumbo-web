## Getting started

Styles in the Rumbo web application are made with a combination of two libraries:

- Tailwind css
- Css modules

You should to use tailwind classes to style your components and only when those classes dont feet your needs use scss modules (for reference, the Spinner component uses scss modules)

Icons:

We only use icons from this library: https://simplelineicons.github.io/
